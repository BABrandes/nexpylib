# Documentation Review Report

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Reviewed by:** AI Assistant  
**Status:** Issues Found

## Summary

I've reviewed all documentation files and found **inconsistencies** between the documentation and the actual codebase. The main issue relates to naming conventions for selection objects.

---

## Issues Found

### 1. **XSetSelect vs XSetSingleSelect** (Critical)

**Severity:** High  
**Files Affected:**
- `docs/api_reference.md`
- `docs/examples.md` 
- `docs/architecture.md`
- `README.md`

**Issue:**
The documentation uses `XSetSelect` (lines 373, 455-485 in various files), but this class/alias **does not exist** in the exports.

**Actual Exports in `src/nexpy/__init__.py`:**
```python
from .x_objects.set_like.x_selection_set import XSelectionSet as XSetSingleSelect
from .x_objects.set_like.x_optional_selection_set import XOptionalSelectionSet as XSetSingleSelectOptional
from .x_objects.set_like.x_multi_selection_set import XMultiSelectionSet as XSetMultiSelect
```

**What exists:**
- `XSetSingleSelect` ✅
- `XSetSingleSelectOptional` ✅
- `XSetMultiSelect` ✅

**What does NOT exist:**
- `XSetSelect` ❌

**Recommendation:**
Choose one of the following options:

**Option A (Recommended):** Update documentation to use the actual exported names
- Replace all `nx.XSetSelect` with `nx.XSetSingleSelect`
- This ensures documentation matches the actual API

**Option B:** Add alias in `__init__.py`
- Add: `XSetSelect = XSetSingleSelect` 
- Update `__all__` to include `'XSetSelect'`
- This makes the API match the documentation

---

### 2. **CHANGELOG.md Outdated**

**Severity:** Medium  
**File:** `CHANGELOG.md`

**Issue:**
The CHANGELOG doesn't reflect recent changes. Based on git status, significant changes have been made:

**Recent Changes Not Documented:**
- Deletion of `src/nexpy/core/nexus_system/__init__.py`
- Deletion of `src/nexpy/x_objects_base/carries_some_hooks_base.py`
- Creation of `src/nexpy/x_objects_base/x_base.py`
- Multiple modifications to core files (hooks, nexus_system, x_objects)

**Recommendation:**
Update CHANGELOG.md with an "[Unreleased]" section documenting:
- Breaking changes (if any)
- New features
- Refactorings
- Removed files and their replacements

---

### 3. **README.md Mentions XSetSelect**

**Severity:** Medium  
**File:** `README.md`

**Issue:**
Line 280 in README.md lists:
```markdown
- `XSetSelect` — Select elements from sets
```

But `XSetSelect` is not exported.

**Recommendation:**
Update to:
```markdown
- `XSetSingleSelect` — Select single elements from sets
```

---

## Documentation Otherwise Up-to-Date

### ✅ **Good News:**

1. **No references to deleted files:**
   - No mentions of `carries_some_hooks_base.py`
   - No mentions of `nexus_system/__init__.py`

2. **API documentation is accurate for:**
   - `FloatingHook` ✅
   - `OwnedHook` ✅
   - `XValue` ✅
   - `XDict` ✅
   - `XList` ✅
   - `XSet` ✅
   - `XDictSelect` ✅
   - `XDictSelectOptional` ✅
   - `XDictSelectDefault` ✅
   - `XDictSelectOptionalDefault` ✅
   - `XSetMultiSelect` ✅
   - Nexus system ✅
   - NexusManager ✅
   - Hook protocols ✅

3. **Examples are functional:**
   - All code examples use correct imports
   - Examples follow best practices
   - Float accuracy configuration examples are accurate

4. **Core concepts documentation:**
   - Internal synchronization docs are accurate ✅
   - Architecture docs are accurate ✅
   - Concepts docs are accurate ✅
   - Usage guide is accurate ✅

## Commands to Fix

Here are the specific changes needed:

```bash
# Fix api_reference.md
sed -i '' 's/XSetSelect/XSetSingleSelect/g' docs/api_reference.md

# Fix examples.md
sed -i '' 's/nx.XSetSelect/nx.XSetSingleSelect/g' docs/examples.md
sed -i '' 's/### Example 11: Set Selection/### Example 11: Set Single Selection/g' docs/examples.md

# Fix architecture.md
sed -i '' 's/XSetSelect/XSetSingleSelect/g' docs/architecture.md

# Fix README.md
sed -i '' 's/`XSetSelect`/`XSetSingleSelect`/g' README.md

# Fix __init__.py docstring
# (Manual edit needed for line 166)
```

---

## Testing Recommendations

After making the changes:

1. **Verify imports work:**
   ```python
   import nexpy as nx
   
   # These should work:
   obj = nx.XSetSingleSelect({1, 2, 3}, selection=1)
   assert hasattr(nx, 'XSetSingleSelect')
   assert hasattr(nx, 'XSetSingleSelectOptional')
   assert hasattr(nx, 'XSetMultiSelect')
   
   # This should NOT work:
   try:
       obj = nx.XSetSelect({1, 2, 3}, selection=1)
       assert False, "XSetSelect should not exist!"
   except AttributeError:
       pass  # Expected
   ```

2. **Run all examples from documentation** to ensure they work

3. **Update tests** if any reference `XSetSelect`

---

## Conclusion

The documentation is **mostly accurate** with the exception of the `XSetSelect` naming issue. This is a **user-facing API inconsistency** that should be fixed promptly.

**Recommendation:** Go with **Option A** (update docs to use `XSetSingleSelect`) as it's clearer and more explicit about what type of selection is being performed (single vs multi).

All other documentation appears to be up-to-date with the recent code changes.
