"""
Hook system for nexpylib.

This module provides a flexible, composable hook architecture for reactive programming.
Hooks are the primary way to create and manage synchronized reactive values in nexpylib.

Architecture:
    - protocols/: Interface definitions (what hooks CAN do)
    - foundation/: Core base implementation
    - mixins/: Reusable behaviors via composition
    - implementations/: Concrete hook types

Main Hook Types:
    - FloatingHook: A writable, reactive hook without an owner
    - OwnedReadOnlyHook: A read-only hook owned by a reactive object
    - OwnedWritableHook: A writable hook owned by a reactive object

Key Protocols:
    - HookProtocol: Core hook interface
    - OwnedHookProtocol: Adds ownership semantics
    - WritableHookProtocol: Adds mutation capability
    - ReactiveHookProtocol: Adds reaction/callback support
